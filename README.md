# LESSON 1 INTRODUCTION TO THE HYBRID CLOUD

## Reflexions by the Instructor

Many customers newly discovered virtualization in relation to Cloud. Suddenly, many companies branded their products as Cloud-ready, not saying what “ready” really meant:
only backup in the Cloud, migration between physical systems and the Public Cloud, migration within  the Cloud, inclusion of Private Clouds, or Disaster Recovery in the Cloud.

Suddenly, many companies decided to go Cloud despite that Cloud not necessarily providing what on-prem had until then. Typically to move away from Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) 
with its upfront server-farm costs and in-house maintenance, to Operational Expenditures (OPEX).

Nutanix is a company with built-in functionality for virtualization and Cloud. Since that time, it has become clear that “The Cloud” is a concept that has different meanings to 
different people and companies: sometimes an intangible concept, but always showing the need for people who truly understand Cloud concepts and, perhaps more importantly, can
execute on them.

After an introduction in technology history related to the Cloud, we will discuss what makes a company cloud-ready, what the differences are between private/public/multi/hyper
cloud, what the pros and cons are of the various Cloud implementation, and how to place and migrate data.

## Why are Hybrid Cloud Engineers needed?

Most companies have plans for transitioning their IT to a cloud-focused model. There are a few challenges when it comes to this because carrying out these plans and reaching these goals are a little easier said than done.

Here are the two main reasons for the difficulties:

* The first one is a lack of organizational readiness. Having a cloud-focused model affects many aspects of the organization outside of the tech-side, like people and processes. Each business has to prepare for these impacts during their Cloud adoption plans.

* Second, adding technology doesn't necessarily add value unless there's a clear goal or outcome to be achieved.

<strong>To avoid these challenges, you need to focus on business requirements first. Once you've figured out the business requirements, you can then match those requirements to technologies that help achieve those goals or requirements. Then, you need the right mix of skills to carry the plan out.</strong>

This is where the Hybrid Cloud Engineer comes in. The engineer is needed to help organizations successfully plan and implement their cloud transformation.

<strong>A hybrid cloud engineer can bring in new technologies quickly, analyze competition, and create comparisons between old and new ways of doing business. Hybrid cloud engineers are able to modernize any organization, but they will find every business increasingly requiring hybrid capabilities to compete on a global scale.</strong>

## What does a Hybrid Cloud Engineer do?

<strong>A hybrid cloud engineer can design, create, operate, and manage different types of workloads across multiple clouds and infrastructure providers.</strong>

The engineer should be able to:

* Consult and plan with business stakeholders
* Successfully execute this plan
* Validate outcomes through their technical skillset

The Hybrid Cloud Engineer helps organizations determine their readiness, and make suggestions if an organization isn't ready yet. <strong>One of the most important things to check is if business requirements are clearly defined</strong>. This is done through Service Level Agreements, or SLAs, need to be completely documented and enforceable. This is what you're going to use to choose the right infrastructure for every service.

This is followed by implementation.

<strong>Implementation involves planning and executing migration</strong>. This involves a few things like <strong>refactoring applications for the best possible Total Cost of Ownership, or TCO, and Return On Investment, or ROI</strong>. Once complete, the technical and organizational infrastructure needs to be <strong>continuously monitored to check if performance expectations that were created in the SLAs are met</strong>.

## Digital Transformation

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/HYBRID-CLOUD-ENGINEER-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM-/main/images/6.jpg)

The need for complex and specialized silos for data center infrastructure was removed by public cloud providers through the commoditization of the IT industry. This is called <strong>digital transformation</strong> (or DX) in the industry and refers to traditional IT practices making the effort necessary to modernize. Naturally, this takes a lot of time and resources.

<strong>Now, companies that have on-prem data centers have more difficulty evolving than newer organizations that have always utilized the public cloud</strong>. The hybrid cloud helps bring both sides together by addressing their operations and their workloads. We're going to cover the evolution of IT that brought us to where we are today, to show how the hybrid cloud helps resolve a lot of these issues.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/HYBRID-CLOUD-ENGINEER-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM-/main/images/7.jpg)

<strong>Businesses have changed their course of operations due to disruptive technology waves with digital transformation</strong>. According to a recent IDC study, digital transformation will consume half of all information technology budgets by 2023. Both delivery times and <strong>Moore’s Law</strong> have been show to disrupt how businesses operations historically.

An example of this is how data centers with their thousands of physical servers overtook mainframes.

Procuring, installing, configuring, and bring up a new server in their data center would take months. <strong>In order to significantly reduce the amount of time, data centers consolidated hundreds of physical servers running virtual machine workloads</strong>. The rise of public and private clouds came from the delivery of virtualization with on-demand consumption. This only needed half of the resources required from the virtualized data center.

<strong>As a hybrid cloud engineer, your role will be to help an organization modernize its operations and infrastructure, regardless of where they are at IT-wise.</strong>

You'll be able to help an organization’s growth by recognizing, understanding, and capitalizing on opportunities to migrate to more efficient technologies.

## Understanding the Cloud

### The Cloud is an Experience and a Mindset

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/HYBRID-CLOUD-ENGINEER-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM-/main/images/9.jpg)

NIST defines cloud computing as "a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. For instance: networks, servers, storage, applications, and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction."

According to NIST, the cloud model has 5 essential characteristics, 3 service models, and 4 deployment models.

### Service Models

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/HYBRID-CLOUD-ENGINEER-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM-/main/images/10.jpg)

You're able to run both traditional and newer cloud-focused applications in a variety of places. The progression of managed service providers up the technology stack were driven by technology waves. From delivering Infrastructure as a Service, to on demand Virtual Machines, to platforms, and to full software.

Running applications on bare-metal are involved in traditional on-prem IT. An example of this is when, in the co-location mode, you can choose to run your applications in a third-party managed data center. This type of hosting model involves managing only your applications instead of the underlying hardware. The virtualization layer and above is the focus.

* With <strong>Infrastructure as a Service</strong>, or IaaS, you are only managing the workloads and applications that are running on virtual machines and containers.

* With <strong>Platform as a Service</strong>, or PaaS, you are only responsible for applications and their data.

* Finally, with a <strong>Software as a Service</strong>, or SaaS, model, every aspect of the infrastructure is provided to you. The only thing that you are required to manage is the data. Everything else is being managed by a provider.

Understanding all of these models is an area of expertise for hybrid cloud engineers in order to know which the best ones are to leverage.

You need to answer 4 main questions to start the organization's digital transformation:

How do you leave traditional IT behind and become a Cloud consumer?
How do you choose between application hosts? Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, or Software as a Service?
How does your choice impact workload design, deployment, management, and costs?
Can you leverage multiple models effectively?
Once you receive the answers, you're a lot closer.

## Application Design: The Monolith

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/HYBRID-CLOUD-ENGINEER-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM-/main/images/12.jpg)

Application development has been influenced by the technology stack. The application design was both constrained to one infrastructure vendor with past monolithic infrastructure. When we refer to <strong>monolithic</strong>, we mean there is one, single source of every component in the stack.

Only big businesses or government agencies could afford the monolithic infrastructure because the costs were so high. These applications are still around. For example, there's a banking application written in COBOL for a mainframe and that's been in use for the last 40 years.

Some challenges with applications like this are:

* It is a single application written in a single language.
* It is run in a batch, or is constantly executed on a single instance of infrastructure.
* To address performance issues and bottlenecks, it is necessary to scale up by increasing compute, storage, and memory resources. These resources are always constrained to a monolithic server’s capabilities.
* The infrastructure is also monolithic. It is provided by a single vendor, who potentially also controls the application development tools, database, and operating system layers that are running on their hardware.

These challenges can be mitigated despite monoliths existing everywhere and being both difficult and expensive to maintain.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/HYBRID-CLOUD-ENGINEER-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM-/main/images/13.jpg)

## Application Design: Distributed Web Scale

The Internet and open source software lowered application design costs and changed to being distributed over the network. The functionality became a separation of duties from being monolithic.

You can easily see this was a typical three-tier web application, this includes:

* The web presentation-tier using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
* The application logic tier using programming languages such as: Java, C++, Python, or Ruby
* A database cluster for persistence.

By having every tier operate independently of the other tiers, this allows infinitely scaling out to accommodate demand. This can either be done by increasing or decreasing the population of the tier and distributing work in parallel.

Micro-service architecture with further separation of tier function allows application architecture to evolve towards network APIs based on the web, called RESTful APIs, or REST APIs.

Today’s cloud infrastructure is networked, which isn't like the single vendor's technology stack in monolithic architecture. When any individual member fails load balancers distribute each application tier's requests and maintain high availability. Every endpoint behind the load balancer can be hosted anywhere and mixed between different technologies which allows hybrid cloud mixing of IaaS , PaaS, and SaaS.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/HYBRID-CLOUD-ENGINEER-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM-/main/images/14.jpg)

Here is an example 3-tier web application that incorporates distributed web scale application design concepts such as load balancing and scale out fleet management of each application tier. A customer request comes to a web load balancer.

The web load balancer directs the request to any of the web presentation tier members, in this case Web4, to show a web page which needs to display application logic served through the AppServer Load Balancer from the Application Logic Tier members, in this case from AppServer2. AppServer2, in turn, reads data from the database cluster, in this case: the Database3 instance.

You can see that each tier can scale independently for performance and can survive partial failures for high availability. You could lose or maintain Web1, AppServer3, and Database4 without significant impact to the three-tier web application. Today's applications are multilingual with a distributed architecture over the network for vast scalability, leveraging web technologies for APIs. These apps can be hosted on any infrastructure in a hybrid cloud fashion.

Examples of these web-scale applications with a global reach are Facebook, Netflix, and Gmail.

## The Cloud Differentiator

There are many reasons that organizations are more and more interested in making the transition to the cloud. What differentiates the organizations that use it from the organizations that do not? Why is the cloud so important?

The NIST definition can provide some clarity on what the cloud is:

In the State of the DevOps Report 2019, it was determined that the highest performing teams are <strong>24 times</strong> more likely to execute on all five cloud capabilities, when compared to lower performing teams. The cloud, therefore, can be viewed as a differentiator for elite performers as well as a tool in general that drives high performance.

There are first two major aspects of cloud consumption that organizations need to take into consideration: fiscal consumption and workload predictability.

## Cloud Considerations

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/HYBRID-CLOUD-ENGINEER-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM-/main/images/16.jpg)

Let's zoom out a bit. Think about this, there are two basic consumption models: renting and buying.

Renting can have low entry costs, but higher long-term costs. These can be described as operational expenditures verses capital expenditures that can be blended based on needs usually. The business model everyone wants, is to blend the best of both worlds: renting and buying, OpEx and CapEx, to address variable and fixed workloads.

Think about staying in a hotel as opposed to buying a house. Would you buy a house when you go on vacation? Would you stay in a hotel for year? When would you rent a car over buying one?

The public cloud’s optimal use-case is utility computing for workloads which can be turned on-and-off at will.

The private cloud’s optimal use-case is for fixed, long-running and ongoing workloads. In other words, a business can purchase on-prem private cloud and depreciate that investment as a capital expenditure, or CapEx, but also purchase off-prem private cloud resources for backup, burst load, and temporary workload needs as OpEx to augment their baseline workload capacity.

Control and management of workloads across public and private clouds is what the hybrid cloud allows.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/HYBRID-CLOUD-ENGINEER-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM-/main/images/17.jpg)

## Cloud Considerations: Workload Predictability

Depending on the nature of the workload determines where it will run best.

The public cloud is best for elastic workloads. The public cloud allows you to spin up or spin down resources to meet the workload’s demands quickly, easily, and efficiently when a workload is unpredictable.

The private cloud is great for predictable workloads. It is a secure and efficient way to run core workloads, with the agility and sit-back simplicity that IT teams want, and with the control that an organization needs for on-prem workloads.

A hybrid cloud blends these two worlds together.

Distribute workloads across public and private cloud, still allows you to control and manage them centrally. The overall management of your deployment is simplified this way. This provides the required flexibility to make the best financial choice for your workloads, and deploy them where they run best.

## Organizational Readiness Fundamentals

The first step in executing a cloud transformation plan is determining an organization’s cloud readiness. You need to understand how the organization is currently delivering IT, what technologies are being used, and what they mean for the organization’s ability to transition to the cloud to complete an organizational readiness assessment. This will determine if an organization is ready to make the transition, what the gaps are, and how those gaps need to be addressed for successful migration. It's critical that a hybrid cloud engineer understand these items.

Almost every business has a cloud transformation plan. Problems for businesses executing their digital and cloud transformation plans can be caused by their organizational models. Organizational models can refer to how an IT department is structured for example and how technology is actually used. These two models speak to organizational readiness. <strong>Organizational readiness</strong> refers to how ready a business is to execute their cloud transformation plan successfully.

Why do business think about fiscal consumption and their workload predictability? Usually, those conversations begin when a business is considering making the transition to the cloud.

The entire assessment begins with the org chart.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/May/5eb43d4c_slide-41-organizational-readiness-fundamentals/slide-41-organizational-readiness-fundamentals.png)

One of the most important parts of the process is gathering detailed information and knowing the key stakeholders early on. There are different IT domains to learn as well as what they do to deliver business services.

Your findings will allow you to create a map of the technologies and organizational models used across the organization. Then, assign a cloud readiness score to each domain. We are going to use a very simple metric to assign that score that we'll cover next.

## What is Cloud Readiness?

The readiness of each organizational model or technology used is either ready or it's not. You'll notice this when you perform organizational assessments. You assign every items a high or low score.

<strong>Low Cloud Readiness</strong>
A low cloud readiness score means that technology and workforce skills are more traditional. This means the current environment is used exclusively to run legacy, shrink-wrapped applications.

The IT staff managing the physical infrastructure could be siloed, based on the 3-tier model. An example of this scenario, is if legacy technology and organizational models are currently supporting IT. Or, if many workloads are running on bare metal and traditional, monolithic applications are the norm. A platform upgrade and workforce up-skilling create the possibility to facilitate cloud transformation so adopting the hybrid cloud model is not a problem too great to overcome.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/HYBRID-CLOUD-ENGINEER-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM-/main/images/20.jpg)

<strong>High Cloud Readiness</strong>
High cloud readiness means that the technologies and workforce skills that support IT are aligned with what is required to successfully use the full capabilities of the public, private and hybrid cloud. A good example of this scenario is if catalog-based self-service is available to users.

Having a DevOps initiative and micro-service-based application architecture in use,​ or containers being used for some applications would make it easy to move to a hybrid cloud.

## Cloud Smart, Not Cloud First

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/June/5ed5a7f2_screen-shot-2020-06-01-at-9.13.38-pm/screen-shot-2020-06-01-at-9.13.38-pm.png)

The US government adopted a Cloud First strategy nine years ago. Most departments began implementing a lift-and-shift strategy. This was done to move their applications into the public cloud or multiple public clouds. We started to see this was becoming expensive and wasn't really benefitting the government very much. The way they handled moving to the cloud was a problem. The Cloud First approach is still popular, but being Cloud Smart is the right way to go.

<strong>Cloud Smart</strong>is about rationalizing applications, infrastructure, skills, and people across hybrid clouds and ensuring everything is where it fits best.

You can leverage the essential characteristics of the cloud over various deployment models by looking at the cloud as an experience and a mindset. Since everything is on demand, it doesn’t take ten hours or six months to get a cloud result. Rapid elasticity with service measurements allows these organizations to understand how well they’re managing their on-prem and off-prem resources.

That is the difference between Cloud First – where everyone starts – and Cloud Smart.

## Why Cloud Smart?

Cloud First was wasteful for many early adopters.

Organizations that used a lift-and-shift approach to the process took a VM disk, a snapshot of a server, and moved them to a single public cloud. This meant that there was downtime and that they were locking into a single public cloud. Running a workload 24 hours a day, 7 days a week was a huge operating expenditure. It's cheaper to run this type of workload on-prem.

The lock-in combined with the increased OpEx required a second lift and shift, to return to the on-prem CaPex model. This wound up wasting time, money, and effort on moving their workloads back and forth. After all this, they found themselves right back to where they started.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/May/5eb33600_screen-shot-2020-05-06-at-6.11.02-pm/screen-shot-2020-05-06-at-6.11.02-pm.png)

<strong>What needs to change?</strong>
The short version is that lifting-and-shifting all of your workloads to a single provider is a mistake. What’s required is the cloud-smart model, which the US Government advocated in 2019.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/May/5eb43a99_screen-shot-2020-05-07-at-12.42.50-pm/screen-shot-2020-05-07-at-12.42.50-pm.png)

What you’re seeing here is directly from the CIO of the US Government.

* It comes down to needing to move towards hybrid, multi-cloud environments to avoid lock-in.
* There’s a need to address the long-term inefficiencies of migrating applications as-is. This is what caused the OpEx burden from lifting and shifting into the public cloud.
* It’s necessary to rationalize the work and identify the immediate financial cost of modernization, so that it is easier to identify where the right place is to run a specific workload.

This is how you use the Cloud Smart model to move towards successful digital transformation.

## Legacy IT: The Mainframe

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/HYBRID-CLOUD-ENGINEER-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM-/main/images/23.jpg)

To really look at how technology evolved to give us the cloud, let's start with the mainframe. Mainframes are still integral to many enterprises’ IT infrastructure. The mainframe is monolithic architecture that first appeared on the computing landscape in the 1940s.

Over 70% of the Fortune 500 companies still use mainframes for business-critical applications. Common use cases include Online Transaction Processing, or OLTP, for banking, Government, Utilities, Education, and Research. Mainframes also support Linux, Java, Scala, Python, TensorFlow, and Apache SparkML for machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. Their tremendous processing power and security capabilities also make mainframes ideal Blockchain hosts.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/May/5eb43d03_slide-58-mainframes-advantages/slide-58-mainframes-advantages.png)

<strong>Advantages</strong>

There are several reasons for the mainframe’s continued popularity.

The enormous resources and computing power that is provides via its monolithic, converged architecture. It is, for example, 18 times faster than an x86 platform.

It also provides decades of uptime and provides high levels of security.

It also supports virtualization, which is an increasingly critical element of computing infrastructure today.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/May/5eb43de5_slide-59-mainframes-disadvantages/slide-59-mainframes-disadvantages.png)

<strong>Disadvantages</strong>

Despite its many advantages, the mainframe isn’t the perfect solution for all computing needs.

Having access to the extensive amount of resources a mainframe provides requires a massive capital investment.

Mainframes only get more expensive when they need to scale, because their monolithic architectures require massive blocks to expand.

There’s also the concern of vendor lock-in, due to the use of proprietary hardware and software.

Finally, operating, managing, and maintaining such a complex piece of computing technology requires highly specialized skills.

## Legacy IT: Distributed Computing

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/HYBRID-CLOUD-ENGINEER-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM-/main/images/25.jpg)

In the 80s, there was a need for departmental computing, which coincided with advances in memory, storage, software, LAN, and WAN technologies.

Mass-produced microprocessors were suddenly everywhere. Commodity operating systems and competing manufacturers further accelerated innovation in software and hardware. Open networking standards, especially IEEE 802.3 and TCP/IP, and the push to establish global networks, began to break down the monolithic, proprietary computing models of the mainframe era. Smaller, cheaper servers could be used to build infrastructure one box at a time. LAN technologies and open standards like TCP/IP made it easier to network stand-alone servers and provided cheaper, faster scalability.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/May/5eb43f34_slide-63-distributed-computing-advantages./slide-63-distributed-computing-advantages..png)

<strong>Advantages</strong>

* The low cost, making the barrier to entry very low. This was a dramatic change from the enormous investments required to stand up a mainframe.
* By design, these systems were also easier to scale, making it much easier to expand an environment to meet growing needs. Most standards were open and because hardware and software were commoditized, businesses had a wealth of choices when making purchases.
* Since these were commoditized systems, niche skills were no longer needed to operate and manage them.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/May/5eb43fd4_slide-64-distributed-computing-disadvantages./slide-64-distributed-computing-disadvantages..png)


<strong>Disadvantages</strong>

* Underutilization was the norm, which resulted in low return on investment, and high total cost of ownership.
* Despite being scalable, these systems were not highly available, opening businesses to the risks of downtime and data loss.
* The inherent scalability of the distributed systems also led to sprawl, which made them difficult to secure and manage.
* Finally, because of the sheer number of components involved in different systems, IT organizations experienced sprawl as well, becoming disjointed and siloed.
