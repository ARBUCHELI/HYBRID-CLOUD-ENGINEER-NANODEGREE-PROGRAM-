# LESSON 1 INTRODUCTION TO THE HYBRID CLOUD

## Reflexions by the Instructor

Many customers newly discovered virtualization in relation to Cloud. Suddenly, many companies branded their products as Cloud-ready, not saying what “ready” really meant:
only backup in the Cloud, migration between physical systems and the Public Cloud, migration within  the Cloud, inclusion of Private Clouds, or Disaster Recovery in the Cloud.

Suddenly, many companies decided to go Cloud despite that Cloud not necessarily providing what on-prem had until then. Typically to move away from Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) 
with its upfront server-farm costs and in-house maintenance, to Operational Expenditures (OPEX).

Nutanix is a company with built-in functionality for virtualization and Cloud. Since that time, it has become clear that “The Cloud” is a concept that has different meanings to 
different people and companies: sometimes an intangible concept, but always showing the need for people who truly understand Cloud concepts and, perhaps more importantly, can
execute on them.

After an introduction in technology history related to the Cloud, we will discuss what makes a company cloud-ready, what the differences are between private/public/multi/hyper
cloud, what the pros and cons are of the various Cloud implementation, and how to place and migrate data.

## Prerequisites

In order to take this course, you should be comfortable with command line on Linux or Windows. It would also be helpful for you to have a background in working with VMs as well as
AWS or GCP cloud.

Please note: There are no AWS credits needed for this Nanodegree.

## Course Outline

In this course, we're going to cover:

* The Journey to the Modern Hybrid Cloud
* Introduce you to the Nutanix HCI
* Hybrid Cloud Security

# LESSON 2 JOURNEY TO THE MODERN HYBRID CLOUD

## Lesson Overview

Lesson Overview
Welcome to the Journey to the Modern Hybrid Cloud!

In this lesson, we’re going to cover:

* What the role of a Hybrid Cloud Engineer is

* The different models to support various Cloud initiatives

* The Engineer’s role in Service Level Agreements related to Cloud apps

* How to choose the optimal Cloud platform for an app, based on business requirements and SLAs

## Why are Hybrid Cloud Engineers needed?

Most companies have plans for transitioning their IT to a cloud-focused model. There are a few challenges when it comes to this because carrying out these plans and reaching these goals are a little easier said than done.

Here are the two main reasons for the difficulties:

* The first one is a lack of organizational readiness. Having a cloud-focused model affects many aspects of the organization outside of the tech-side, like people and processes. Each business has to prepare for these impacts during their Cloud adoption plans.

* Second, adding technology doesn't necessarily add value unless there's a clear goal or outcome to be achieved.

To avoid these challenges, you need to focus on business requirements first. Once you've figured out the business requirements, you can then match those requirements to technologies that help achieve those goals or requirements. Then, you need the right mix of skills to carry the plan out.

This is where the Hybrid Cloud Engineer comes in. The engineer is needed to help organizations successfully plan and implement their cloud transformation.

A hybrid cloud engineer can bring in new technologies quickly, analyze competition, and create comparisons between old and new ways of doing business. Hybrid cloud engineers are able to modernize any organization, but they will find every business increasingly requiring hybrid capabilities to compete on a global scale.

## What does a Hybrid Cloud Engineer do?

A hybrid cloud engineer can design, create, operate, and manage different types of workloads across multiple clouds and infrastructure providers.

The engineer should be able to:

* Consult and plan with business stakeholders
* Successfully execute this plan
* Validate outcomes through their technical skillset

The Hybrid Cloud Engineer helps organizations determine their readiness, and make suggestions if an organization isn't ready yet. One of the most important things to check is if business requirements are clearly defined. This is done through Service Level Agreements, or SLAs, need to be completely documented and enforceable. This is what you're going to use to choose the right infrastructure for every service.

This is followed by implementation.

Implementation involves planning and executing migration. This involves a few things like refactoring applications for the best possible Total Cost of Ownership, or TCO, and Return On Investment, or ROI. Once complete, the technical and organizational infrastructure needs to be continuously monitored to check if performance expectations that were created in the SLAs are met.

## Digital Transformation

The need for complex and specialized silos for data center infrastructure was removed by public cloud providers through the commoditization of the IT industry. This is called <strong>digital transformation</strong> (or DX) in the industry and refers to traditional IT practices making the effort necessary to modernize. Naturally, this takes a lot of time and resources.

Now, companies that have on-prem data centers have more difficulty evolving than newer organizations that have always utilized the public cloud. The hybrid cloud helps bring both sides together by addressing their operations and their workloads. We're going to cover the evolution of IT that brought us to where we are today, to show how the hybrid cloud helps resolve a lot of these issues.

Businesses have changed their course of operations due to disruptive technology waves with digital transformation. According to a recent IDC study, digital transformation will consume half of all information technology budgets by 2023. Both delivery times and <strong>Moore’s Law</strong> have been show to disrupt how businesses operations historically.

An example of this is how data centers with their thousands of physical servers overtook mainframes.

Procuring, installing, configuring, and bring up a new server in their data center would take months. In order to significantly reduce the amount of time, data centers consolidated hundreds of physical servers running virtual machine workloads. The rise of public and private clouds came from the delivery of virtualization with on-demand consumption. This only needed half of the resources required from the virtualized data center.

<strong>As a hybrid cloud engineer, your role will be to help an organization modernize its operations and infrastructure, regardless of where they are at IT-wise.</strong>

You'll be able to help an organization’s growth by recognizing, understanding, and capitalizing on opportunities to migrate to more efficient technologies.
