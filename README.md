# LESSON 1 INTRODUCTION TO THE HYBRID CLOUD

# Reflexions by the Instructor

Many customers newly discovered virtualization in relation to Cloud. Suddenly, many companies branded their products as Cloud-ready, not saying what “ready” really meant:
only backup in the Cloud, migration between physical systems and the Public Cloud, migration within  the Cloud, inclusion of Private Clouds, or Disaster Recovery in the Cloud.

Suddenly, many companies decided to go Cloud despite that Cloud not necessarily providing what on-prem had until then. Typically to move away from Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) 
with its upfront server-farm costs and in-house maintenance, to Operational Expenditures (OPEX).

Nutanix is a company with built-in functionality for virtualization and Cloud. Since that time, it has become clear that “The Cloud” is a concept that has different meanings to 
different people and companies: sometimes an intangible concept, but always showing the need for people who truly understand Cloud concepts and, perhaps more importantly, can
execute on them.

After an introduction in technology history related to the Cloud, we will discuss what makes a company cloud-ready, what the differences are between private/public/multi/hyper
cloud, what the pros and cons are of the various Cloud implementation, and how to place and migrate data.
